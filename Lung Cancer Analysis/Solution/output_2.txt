Accuracies of SVM models over different kernels:

	Accuracy of Linear Kernel SVM : 0.83
	Accuracy of Quadratic Kernel SVM : 0.50
	Accuracy of Radial Kernel SVM : 0.50

Accuracy of MLPClassifier (single-layer- [16,]) : 0.67
Accuracy of MLPClassifier (2-layer [256, 16]) : 0.83

Out of the two models, bilayer MLP is selected due to higher accuracy(0.83). 

Accuracies of selected MLP model over learning rates:

	Accuracy with learning rate 0.1 : 0.83
	Accuracy with learning rate 0.01 : 0.83
	Accuracy with learning rate 0.001 : 0.83
	Accuracy with learning rate 0.0001 : 0.83
	Accuracy with learning rate 1e-05 : 0.33

Out of the models, learning rate of 0.1 is selected due to highest accuracy(0.83).
